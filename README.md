# hierarchicalBRG

This is a repository for the paper named "Marking Estimation in Petri Nets Using Hierarchical Basis
Reachability Graphs".


Please see the PDF file named "Benchmark_HBRG.pdf" for the benchmarks described in the paper.

<h1>Please see HBRGCode directory for the codes of the paper.</h1>  

This program requires Java Development Kit (JDK) 6 or higher version.

The entry point of the program is the <B>main</B> function in <B>EntryPoint.java</B>

To test the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical BRG, the reader can call the function <B>testHBRG</B> in <B>EntryPoint.java</B>, whose declear is

```java
void testHBRG(int[][] Pre, int[][] Post, int[] M0, List<String> To, List<String> Tpri)
```

  Input:
  * AA
  - BB
  * CC
